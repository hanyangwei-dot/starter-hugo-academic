title: How to make a person immortal
subtitle: I don't know how to make a person immortal,but I know how to make a person alive until I die.There is no doubt that a brain with unique memory、voice、look decides a person.May be I can train an AI to create a person with a long text about my memory with him. I can also record a person's voice,and add it to the model.May the difficult thing is that I do not have a big server(I have no money).I sincerely hope that the old who raised me could accompany me util my death.

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: I read aloud from 我与地坛,travelled in the author's death wish.It was a moment of realisation that there was nothing more to lose.
So, on this cold winter's day, you see a child running wildly around the playground, tired and sprawled out in the dark.
