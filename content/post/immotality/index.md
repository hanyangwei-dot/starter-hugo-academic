title:  How to make a person immortal?
subtitle: I don't know how to make a person immortal,but I know how to make a person alive until I die.There is no doubt that a brain with unique memory,voice,look decides a person.
# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: I read aloud from 'I am with the altar of earth',travelled in the author's death wish.It was a moment of realisation that there was nothing more to lose.So, on this cold winter's day, you see a child running wildly around the playground, tired and sprawled out in the dark.

May be I can train an AI to create a person with a long text about my memory with him. I can also record a person's voice,and add it to the model.May the difficult thing is that I do not have a big server(I have no money).I sincerely hope that the old who raised me could accompany me util my death.

In me you may see, at this season of the year, the yellow leaves either stripped off, or in twos and threes.
